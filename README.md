# All Java Games:

- Step 3: Make sure to fully install this version of java onto your device
- Step 4: When downloading a jar game, install the zip file under the game you want to play/test
- Step 5: Open the zip file when downloaded (no need to extract all files)
- Step 6: While inside zip file click through until you see the jar file and another zip file
- EXTRA: The zip file connected with the jar file is the code that goes along with the game. If you would like you can modify this code using eclipse or any JRE and test out the code
